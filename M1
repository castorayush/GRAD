ENTRY TO THE EVENT 

Below you will find the digital ticket(s) to the event as a barcode for yourself and your named registered guests for Check-in.

Please  note:

Entrance  to  the  event  is  by  ticket  only  and children, over the age of 3 years, require a ticket to enter the event.
Additional guest tickets will NOT be sold at the venue on the day of the ceremony. 
Additional tickets once purchased are non-refundable.


Check-in

Each barcode can be used once only when scanned at the event Check-in. The Check-in is completed by presenting the barcode from your mobile device or as a print-out at the Check-in Desk.  You are welcome to forward this email to your guests so they can Check-in if they are arriving separately.

To ensure the barcode check-in is as smooth as possible, you will need to ensure that your mobile device or email client is NOT operating in Dark Mode as the scanner cannot read the barcode when it is black-on-black.  Instructions for turning off Dark Mode for Apple iOS and Android.
